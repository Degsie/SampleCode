# externalRequest_getData

This sample shows how to code Misty to get an image from an external resource. In this case, Misty saves the image to her local storage and displays it on her screen.

You can run this code on your robot by uploading the files from this folder to Misty via the Skill Runner web tool. Alternately, refer to this code sample (or copy and paste it into your own skills) when working on similar functionality.
